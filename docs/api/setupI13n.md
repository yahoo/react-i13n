## setupI13n

We provide `setupI13n` as a convenient [higher order function](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750) to setup the ReactI13n, you will need to pass your `top level component`, `options`, and `plugins` into it. This takes care of creating a `ReactI13n` instance and setting up the plugins.

 * `Component` - the top level application component.
 * `options` - the options passed into ReactI13n.
 * `options.rootModelData` - define the `i13nModel` data of the root.
 * `options.I13nNodeClass` - you can inherit the `I13nNode` and add the functionality you need, just pass the class.
 * `options.isViewportEnabled` - define if you want to enable the viewport checking.
 * `options.handlerTimeout` - define the timeout of the event handler, the event callback will be executed even if handlers don't finish in time, default to 1000ms.
 * `options.displayName` - display name of the wrapper component, will fallback to `I13n` + original display name
 * `plugins` - plugins array that you defined according to the definition below.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { setupI13n } from 'react-i13n';
import someReactI13nPlugin from 'some-react-i13n-plugin';

class DemoApp extends React.Component({
    ...
});

const I13nDempApp = setupI13n(DemoApp, {
  rootModelData: {site: 'foo'}, // the default i13n model data to apply to all i13n nodes
  isViewportEnabled: true,
  handlerTimeout: 500
}, [someReactI13nPlugin]);

// then you could use I13nDemoApp to render you app
```

### Create and access the ReactI13n instance

What we do with `setupI13n` is that we will create the `ReactI13n` instance, along with a root node of the I13nTree, passing them via component context to the children.

It's designed to work within React components, you should be able to just use [utilFuctions](https://github.com/yahoo/react-i13n/blob/master/docs/guides/utilFunctions.md) and trigger i13n events. In case you want to do this out of React components, you can access `window._reactI13nInstance` directly.

If you have multiple React trees in one page, we will create multiple i13n trees based on how many React tree you have. On client side the [utilFuctions](https://github.com/yahoo/react-i13n/blob/master/docs/guides/utilFunctions.md) still work based on the global instance object, while on server side, only the children under `setupI13n` can get the React i13n instance as we don't have a proper way to share the ReactI13n instance without causing [memory leak](https://github.com/yahoo/react-i13n/pull/100).


### Util Functions

You will get i13n util functions automatically via `this.props.i13n` by using `setupI13n`, more detail please refer to [util functions](../guides/utilFunctions.md).
