## Creating a plugin

A valid plugin must contain:

- `name` - the plugin name
- `eventHandlers` - handlers functions for the events, typically in the eventHandler function we would send out a tracking beacon, now `react-i13n` has `click`, `created` and `enterViewport`, you can define the events you need and implement the handlers function, e.g., `pageview`.

All of the `eventHandlers` will receive a `payload` object and a `callback` function. By default, in payload you will get:

- `payload.I13nNode` - the I13n node related to the event, then you could use the APIs provided by [I13nNode](../api/I13nNode.md) to get the information you need. It's typically used for default events e.g., `click`, `created`, `enterViewport`. For custom events, if you don't pass `I13nNode`, the default will be the root I13nNode.
- `payload.env` - `server` or `client`, some events e.g., `pageview` will fire on both server and client side, you can define the prefer way you want to handle the beacon.

```js
import { ReactI13n } from 'react-i13n';

// define the plugin
var fooPlugin = {
  name: 'foo',
  eventHandlers: {
    click: function(payload, callback) {
      // click handlers
    },
    pageview: function(payload, callback) {
      if ('client' === payload.env) {
        // client side pageview handlers
      } else {
        // server side pageview handlers
      }
    },
    created: function(payload, callback) {
      // created handlers
    }
  }
};
```

Then we can plug the `plugin` with [setupI13n](../api/setupI13n.md).
