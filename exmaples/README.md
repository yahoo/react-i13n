## I13n Integration Example

We integrate react-i13n to the [flux examples](https://github.com/facebook/flux/tree/master/examples). You can check out and start it as usual, then you can check that the `demo plugin` is working.

* [flux-chat](https://github.com/yahoo/react-i13n/tree/master/exmaples/flux-chat)
* [flux-todomvc](https://github.com/yahoo/react-i13n/tree/master/exmaples/flux-todomvc)

### Demo Plugin

To Provide a clear example, demo-plugin did nothing but shows the beacon content on the screen directly. You can interact with the app, e.g., click items, and see how it looks like.
